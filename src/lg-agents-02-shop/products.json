One mattress is placed on top of the other for single bed use, and they are placed side by side for double bed use when the base is extended. It's important to note that while the bed can be extended into a double, it is not designed to be used as two separate single beds.\n\nThe bed frame is made of powder-coated steel, which is durable and easy to maintain. The design is classic yet flexible, allowing you to style it according to your preferences, either keeping it minimalistic or adding colorful patterns and decor.\n\nKeep in mind that the mattress and bedlinens are sold separately, so you'll need to purchase those to complete the setup. The bed frame comes in two packages, so make sure you have enough space for assembly.\n\nIf you have any specific questions about assembling or styling your day-bed, feel free to ask!",

Ensure you have all the necessary pieces and check them against the instruction manual, which should include a list of all parts.\n\n2. **Locate the Adjustable Feet**: The shelving unit is designed with adjustable feet to provide stability on uneven floors. Identify these and set them aside for later steps.\n\n3. **Assemble the Frame**:\n   - Connect the side panels to the horizontal supports using the pre-drilled holes. This might involve simple slotting or using screws, depending on the design.\n   - Make sure the frame is square and stable before tightening any temporary connections.\n\n4. **Insert the Shelves**:\n   - Slide or place the shelves into the appropriate level within the frame. \n   - Depending on the design, the shelves may rest on built-in supports or may need to be secured with additional hardware.\n\n5. **Adjust the Feet**:\n   - Once the shelving unit is assembled, stand it upright.\n   - Use the adjustable feet to ensure the unit is level. This might involve twisting the feet to lengthen or shorten them until the unit is stable.\n\n6. **Final Tightening and Inspection**:\n   - Go over all connections and make sure everything is tightened according to the instructions.\n   - Check the stability of the unit by gently pressing down on each shelf or corner.\n\nRemember, while tools might not be required, it can be helpful to have a screwdriver or similar tool on hand in case you need to make any adjustments. Always follow the enclosed instruction manual for the best results. If you encounter any issues, consider reaching out to SHOP customer service for additional support.",

Here are some general tips for setting up and using a shelving unit like the SHOP STUDERA:\n\n1. **Assembly**: Follow the included instructions carefully to assemble the shelving unit. Make sure all parts are accounted for before starting the assembly process.\n\n2. **Anchoring**: To prevent tip-over accidents, securely anchor the shelving unit to the wall. Use the appropriate wall anchors for your wall type (drywall, concrete, etc.). SHOP often includes wall anchoring kits with their furniture, but depending on your wall material, you might need additional hardware.\n\n3. **Placement**: Measure your space before placing the shelving unit to ensure it fits well. Avoid placing it in high-traffic areas where it might get bumped into.\n\n4. **Weight Distribution**: Distribute weight evenly across the shelves. Heavier items should be placed on the lower shelves to maintain stability and reduce the risk of tipping.\n\n5. **Maintenance**: Since the unit is made of powder-coated steel, it should be easy to clean. Use a damp cloth to wipe down surfaces and avoid abrasive cleaners that might damage the finish.\n\n6. **Ventilation**: If used in a damp area like a bathroom, make sure there's adequate ventilation to prevent moisture buildup, even though the unit's material is resistant to rust.\n\nFor specific questions about the SHOP STUDERA shelving unit (like dimensions, weight, or current availability), visiting SHOP’s official website or contacting their customer service would provide the most accurate information.",

This cabinet seems to be versatile for various storage needs, whether used in small spaces or as part of a larger system. Here are some additional considerations for using this cabinet effectively:\n\n1. **Installation Options:**\n   - **Wall Mounting:** Using a suspension rail for wall mounting can help you save floor space and create a cleaner look. Ensure your wall is suitable for the max load of the cabinet.\n   - **Floor Placement:** If you prefer placing it on the floor, you'll need to purchase additional feet or legs to support it properly.\n\n2. **Design Flexibility:**\n   - The integrated push-opener is a sleek feature that provides a minimalist aesthetic without external handles.\n   - Combining multiple cabinets can help customize your storage solution ideally for your specific needs, allowing for reconfiguration as those needs evolve.\n\n3. **Functionality:**\n   - The simplicity of assembly facilitated by the wedge dowel and pre-drilled holes makes it convenient for DIY enthusiasts.\n   - Selecting between open storage or enclosed storage with doors allows for different organizational preferences.\n\nWhen planning to purchase or assemble a unit like this, double-check dimensions and ensure the cabinet fits into your desired space and meets weight-holding requirements based on your wall material if you choose to mount it. Don't forget to purchase all necessary accessories, such as suspension rails or floor legs.",

Ensure you choose the right ones for your wall material.\n\n2. **Asymmetrical Design**:\n   - The assembly allows for a personalized setup, making it easy to organize your belongings in a way that suits your preferences.\n\n3. **Space Optimization**:\n   - By mounting the cabinet on the wall, you can use your floor space for other purposes, optimizing the overall layout of the room.\n\n4. **Weight Consideration**:\n   - The cabinet comes in three packages, with a total weight of 3.14 kg. Make sure your wall and mounting system can support the weight, along with anything you plan to store in it.\n\n5. **Unique Assembly Feature**:\n   - The wedge dowel system simplifies assembly by clicking into pre-drilled holes, making it straightforward and efficient to put the cabinet together.\n\nRemember, following the instructions and using the appropriate fixing devices will help ensure a safe and successful installation.",

Mounting on the wall helps save floor space and can provide a cleaner look. If you choose to wall-mount, you'll need the STORHED suspension rail (sold separately) and suitable fixing devices for your wall type.\n\n2. **Weight Capacity**: If placed on the floor, each horizontal surface of the frame can hold a maximum of 20 kg. If wall-mounted, the maximum load capacity depends on the type of wall. It's crucial to ensure that the fixing devices used are appropriate for your wall to safely support the weight.\n\n3. **Stability**: The frame comes with adjustable feet, allowing it to remain stable even on uneven floors. For floor use, note that 60 cm wide frames require 4 legs for proper support.\n\n4. **Interior Organization Options**: To further organize the interior of the frame, you can use STORHED interior fittings, which are also sold separately.\n\n5. **Assembly and Installation**: Always secure the furniture to the wall with the enclosed wall fastener to prevent tipping. This is especially important in homes with children.\n\n6. **Dimensions and Packaging**: The frame comes in a package measuring 69 cm in length, 42 cm in width, 6 cm in height, and weighs 5.95 kg.\n\nFollowing these guidelines will help ensure that the STORHED Frame is used safely and effectively in your space.",

Lay out all parts and hardware before beginning the assembly to ensure you have everything needed.\n\n2. **Wall Fastening**: For safety and stability, the shelving unit must be fixed to the wall using the included fasteners. This is especially important to prevent tipping. Make sure you have the appropriate tools and know the type of wall (e.g., drywall, concrete) to select the right fastener.\n\n3. **Design Flexibility**: The clean lines and simple design allow for versatile use. You can place it against a wall or use it as a room divider, offering both function and style.\n\n4. **Maintenance**: Consider completing the setup with the FÖRFATTARE underframe, which raises the unit for easier cleaning underneath.\n\n5. **Measurements and Space Planning**: Ensure the dimensions, 41 cm width, and 151 cm length, fit your intended space. The unit also comes in two separate packages; one weighs 18.20 kg and the other 19.70 kg.\n\n6. **Room Aesthetics**: The unit’s versatility means it can fit various spaces and styles, offering you lots of storage while keeping a minimalist décor style.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can efficiently assemble and install your FÖRFATTARE shelving unit, making it a functional and stylish addition to your home.",

When guests arrive or if more sleeping space is needed, simply pull out the under-bed base to convert it into a double bed.\n\n2. **Storage Solutions**: The bed comes with three spacious drawers, making it easy to store extra bed linens, pillows, and other essentials within arm’s reach. This added storage feature is ideal for maximizing space in smaller rooms or apartments.\n\n3. **Design and Maintenance**: Featuring a high frame that creates a cocoon-like feeling, the bed is lacquered for easy cleaning and maintenance, ensuring it remains a beautiful and practical piece in your home for years to come.\n\n4. **Configuration**: The day-bed requires two mattresses (80x200 cm), which you stack during daytime use or to use it as a single bed. For a double bed setup, the mattresses are placed side by side.\n\n5. **Product Considerations**: \n   - The SOLVIND day-bed is not meant to be used as two separate single beds.\n   - Mattresses and bedlinen are not included with the purchase.
